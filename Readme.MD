# 🧠 AI Agent Supervisor Workstation

## 📘 Project Overview
The **AI Agent Supervisor Workstation** is a web-based interface designed to empower human supervisors in monitoring, intervening, and optimizing AI-powered customer service agents.  
This platform enables real-time tracking of agent performance, seamless human intervention during live conversations, and fine-grained control over AI behavior through adjustable configurations.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🖥️ 1. Agent Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time overview of ongoing conversations  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs): resolution rate, response time, and satisfaction score  
- Visual alerts for problematic or escalated interactions  
- Search and filtering options by agent ID, customer name, or priority  

### 💬 2. Intervention Interface
- Full conversation history for contextual understanding  
- “**Take Over**” feature allowing supervisors to assume control from the AI  
- “**Return Control**” function with supervisor notes for AI re-engagement  
- Ability to send messages manually as a supervisor with identity labels  

### ⚙️ 3. Agent Configuration
- Adjust AI parameters: temperature, max tokens, response style, etc.  
- Enable/disable AI capabilities (e.g., small talk, escalation handling)  
- Set escalation thresholds for human intervention  
- Save and reuse preset configurations for different AI profiles

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Real-time data simulation**                               | Implemented WebSocket events and dummy data streams to simulate live metrics.  |
| **Maintaining chat context during supervisor intervention** | Used session-based state management with conversation IDs.                     |
| **Limited time for backend deployment**                     | Built a mock API layer using JSON Server for rapid prototyping.                |
| **UI complexity for multiple roles**                        | Simplified user flows with clear role-based access and color-coded interfaces. |
| **Variable substitution clarity**                           | Added real-time preview and tooltips in config panel before saving values.     |
